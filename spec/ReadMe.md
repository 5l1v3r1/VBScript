###### The `spec` folder

# ReadMe.md

### Overview

The `spec` folder contains tests. 
Each test file may contain one or more "specs", or specifications. 
Some are unit tests, and most would more properly be called integration tests. 
A few are intended to be run with elevated privileges. 
Most test files are intended to be run using 64-bit executables, 
but a few are intended to be run using 32-bit executables.

### Launching tests

The tests may be initiated by running directly or by running the files in the folder [examples\test launchers](../examples/test%20launchers).
