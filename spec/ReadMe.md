# Description of the `spec` Folder

### Overview

The `spec` folder contains tests, or "spec" files. 
Each test file may contain one or more "specs", or specifications. 
Some are unit tests, and some are integration tests. 
A few are intended to be run with elevated privileges. 
Most test files are intended to be run using 64-bit executables, 
but a few are intended to be run using 32-bit executables.

### Launching tests

The tests may be initiated by running the `.bat` files in the folder `examples\test launchers`.
